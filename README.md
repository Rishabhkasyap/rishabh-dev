## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I’m a final-year BTech student and a passionate web developer who enjoys building modern, responsive, and scalable applications. With hands-on experience in the **MERN stack**, I love turning ideas into digital reality.

I’ve worked on various projects ranging from doctor appointment systems to social media platforms and e-learning websites. I also completed internships at the **Airport Authority of India** and **Acmegrade**, where I learned about real-world IT infrastructure, full stack development, and software deployment.
